Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

Project Overview

The Telecom Customer Churn Prediction project aims to analyze and predict customer churn using machine learning techniques. Churn is a significant issue in the telecom industry, where customer retention is crucial for business growth. This project identifies key factors influencing churn and builds a predictive model to help telecom companies improve customer retention strategies.

Problem Statement

The primary objective of this project is to determine why customers churn and how to improve customer retention. Research indicates that the average monthly churn rate among the top telecom providers is between 1.9% - 2%. By leveraging data analysis and machine learning, we can identify patterns that lead to customer attrition and develop strategies to reduce churn.

Features & Insights

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Distribution of customer demographics (gender, seniority, tenure, contract type, etc.).

Correlation analysis to determine factors influencing churn.

Visualization of key trends, such as contract type impact on churn.

Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing values and data inconsistencies.

Encoding categorical variables.

Feature engineering for improved model performance.
